# Challenge overview 
It is a casino game: The player starts with 100 Euro. Each turn the player is given three numbers and needs to guess a secret bit. 
If the player guesses correctly they gain 1 Euro, otherwise they lose 1 Euro. The goal of the game is to get 200 Euro to receive the flag.

$p$ is a 2048-bit prime. $a,b,z$ are random values between $1$ and $p-1$ Each turn a secret bit $s$ is chosen.

If $s = 1$, the game returns the following values:

$11^{a} \mod p, 11^{b} \mod p, 11^{a\cdot b} \mod p$

else it returns:

$11^{a} \mod p, 11^{b} \mod p, 11^{z} \mod p$


# Solution

If I could calculate $11^{a\cdot b} \mod p$ from $11^{a} \mod p$ and $11^{b} \mod p$, I would be able to break the Diffie-Hellman protocol and break most of modern encryption. 
According to documentation the random generator `rng = random.SystemRandom()` "uses the os.urandom() function for generating random numbers ". 
As far as I know `os.urandom` is cryptographically secure and unpredictable.

I conclude that the only way is to determine whether we have one or two random numbers our exponent.
1. The product of two random numbers has a $75\%$ chance to be even. A random number only has a $50\%$ chance to be even.
2. A quadratic residue is $a$, in non-scientific terms, a number with a square root modulo $p$. There exists an integer x such that: 
$x \cdot x \mod p = a$
3. Since 11 is a generator, 11 is a non-quadratic residue. Therefore $11^{a}$ can only be a quadratic residue, if a is even.
4. With the legendre symbol function, we can easily determine whether a number is a quadatic residue. The function is simple:

```python
def is_square(num):
    """Using Legendre Symbol to determine if number is square residue"""
    return pow(num, (prime-1)//2, prime) == 1
```
5. If the challenge sends a quadratic residue, it's more likely it was a product of two numbers. Therefore we guess $1$ else we guess $0$. This gives us an advantage and we can get the flag.
