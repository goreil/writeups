# 3x17 [150 pts] 
> 3 x 17 = ?

# Summary
The challenge gives us the ability to write 0x18 bytes to an arbitrary location.
Since we don't know stack addresses, we instead write to the `.fini_array` section which get called
after `main` returns.
First, we create a loop that continiously calls `main` which allows us to write an `execve('/bin/sh')` ROPchain.
Then we overwrite the `.fini_array` a `leave; ret` gadget which triggers the ROPchain.

## Understanding the binary
The binary prompts the user for `addr:` and `data:`. Using `strace` we can see that the addr is passed as an integer and data is written to that address.
```bash
$ strace ./3x17
...
write(1, "addr:", 5addr:)                    = 5
read(0, 1234 "1234\n", 24)                   = 5
write(1, "data:", 5data:)                    = 5
read(0, 1234 0x4d2, 24)                      = -1 EFAULT (Bad address)
...
```
Note: `0x4d2 == 1234`

Notably we are dealing with a No-PIE binary, which gives us some known addresses.
```bash
$ checksec ./3x17
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x400000)
```

## .fini_array
According to the [Linux Standard Base Core Specification](https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/LSB_5.0.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/specialsections.html#AEN743):

> .fini_array	 	
> 
> This section holds an array of function pointers that contributes to a single termination array for the executable or shared object containing the section

This means that the `.fini_array` section is an array of function pointers that get called after `main` returns.
We can show this via the following example:
```c
// gcc fini_test.c -no-pie -o fini_test
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
// Define destructor x
__attribute__((destructor)) void x(){ puts("x() called!");};

void a(){ puts("a() called!"); }
void b(){ puts("b() called!"); }
void c(){ puts("c() called!"); }

// objdump -s -j .fini_array fini_test
void** fini_addr = (void**)0x403e10u ; 
int main(){
    mprotect((void*) 0x403000u, 0x1000, PROT_READ| PROT_WRITE);
    // Overwrite the fini_array
    fini_addr[0] = a;
    fini_addr[1] = b;
    fini_addr[2] = c;
}
```
This example defines one destructor `x()` and then overwrites the `.fini_array` with the functions `a()`, `b()`, and `c()`.
This function prints the following:
```sh
$ gcc fini_test.c -no-pie -o fini_test # Compile with no-pie, so we have the absolute address of .fini_array
$ ./fini_test
b() called!
a() called!
```
We can see that the functions are called in reverse order, which is the order they are stored in the `.fini_array` section.
Also only the first two functions are called, since there is a variable that stores the number of destructors.

```sh
$ objdump -s -j .fini_array fini_test # Show the contents of .fini_array
...
Contents of section .fini_array:
 403e10 20114000 00000000 56114000 00000000   .@.....V.@.....
```
The reason that `.fini_array` has two array elements seems to be because the first element is a `.plt` entry that calls `_dl_runtime_resolve_xsavec`.
Presumably this is a cleanup function that is called after the destructors are called.
The second element is our `x()` destructor.

### .fini_array Deeper dive
How do the functions in `.fini_array` get called? Let's jump into the debugger to find out:
First we [Activate Glibc Source Code in GDB](https://ethanol1310.github.io/2021/07/27/Tutorial/GDB/gdb_4_glibc/) and use [GEF](https://hugsy.github.io/gef/) 
to show the source code while debugging in GDB.
```bash
gdb ./fini_test -ex "b *a" -ex "r" -ex "up" -ex "context"
```

![Backtrace of a destructor function](fini_test_backtrace.png)

Using `up` and `context`, we see that the following code is executed (Glib version 2.35) in ./elf/dl-fini.c:
```c
    139   unsigned int i = (l->l_info[DT_FINI_ARRAYSZ]->d_un.d_val
    140                     / sizeof (ElfW(Addr)));
 →  141   while (i-- > 0)
    142     ((fini_t) array[i]) ();
```

In the challenge we can see similar behavior. If we break at the `.fini_array` element, we reach the following backtrace:
```bash
echo -e "0x4b4000\na" > input
gdb ./3x17 -ex "b*0x0401b00" -ex "r < input"  -ex "up" -ex "context"
```
![Backtrace of 3x17](3x17_backtrace.png)

```mips
     0x402988                  call   QWORD PTR [rbp+rbx*8+0x0]
 →   0x40298c                  sub    rbx, 0x1
     0x402990                  cmp    rbx, 0xffffffffffffffff
```
## Exploitation
A quick objdump shows us that the `.fini_array` section is at `0x4b40f0` and contains 2 pointers.
```bash
$ objdump -s -j .fini_array ./3x17
Contents of section .fini_array:
 4b40f0 001b4000 00000000 80154000 00000000  ..@.......@.....
```

To recap:
1. We can write 0x18 bytes to an arbitrary address with the `main()` function
2. The `_dl_fini()` function calls the two functions in the `.fini_array` section in reverse order

We can use this to create a loop that calls `main()` over and over again, by creating the following .fini_array:

| fini_array[0] | fini_array[1] |
| - | - |
| 0x402960 (_dl_fini) | 0x0401b6d (main) |

This allows us to write arbitrary data to any known writable address.

### Triggering a ROPchain
A problem we run into is that we don't know the address of the stack, so we can't write a ROPchain to the stack.
So we have to pivot to another writable address:
Luckily, when we call `fini_array[0]`, the `$rbp` register is set to `0x4b40f0` which is the address of the `.fini_array` section.

```c
gef➤  reg $rbp
$rbp   : 0x00000000004b40f0  →  0x0000000000401b00
```

This means that we can use the `leave; ret` gadget to pivot to the `.fini_array` section. Quick reminder that leave; ret = 
```mips
mov rsp, rbp + 8; 
pop rbp
ret
```
![Stack before and after the Leave gadget](Leave.png)

### Creating a ROPchain
I just used [angrop](https://github.com/angr/angrop) to automatically generate a ROPchain that calls `execve('/bin/sh')`.
```python
import angr, angrop
p = angr.Project('./3x17')
rop = p.analyses.ROP()
rop.find_gadgets()
chain = rop.execve('/bin/sh', 0, 0)
chain.print_payload_code()
```

# Putting it all together
1. Create a loop that calls `main()` over and over again by overwriting the `.fini_array` section with the following:
    | fini_array[0] | fini_array[1] |
    | - | - |
    | 0x402960 (_dl_fini) | 0x0401b6d (main) |

2. Use this loop to write ropchain after `.fini_array[2]
3. Overwrite `.fini_array[0]` with a `leave; ret` gadget and `.fini_array[1]` with `ret` to trigger the ROPchain

The exploit can be found in [04_3x17.py](04_3x17.py)
